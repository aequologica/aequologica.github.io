# Mugnier & Thiebaud et al.

We are a French duo ; Mugnier writes texts, composes music, and paints pictures, Thiebaud composes music, writes arrangements, and develops software ; although Thiebaud is supposed to be a learned musician, songs by Mugnier are much better, hence Thiebaud's bitter jealousness.

Mugnier and Thiebaud met as teenagers ; Thiebaud enjoys now a well deserved pre-retirement ; Mugnier never ever went through paid work sufferings.

Nor Mugnier neither Thiebaud is skilled or even interested in sound production ; both like songs with nice chords.

We are looking for somebody to contribute to the production of our music, from story telling to sound production to marketing to distribution.

Private soundcloud is here : 
[Sensation on soundclound](https://soundcloud.com/christophe-thiebaud/sensation-new-mix/s-oyXVmEq51cf)
; rather than listening to soundcloud (as said, production is not our strength), we recommend watching the small clip around it :
[Sensation on youtube](https://youtu.be/tkK7Bi7c7Wc), as it somehow distracts from the questionnable sound quality ; you may also want to read what our friends are [telling us about it](https://www.facebook.com/christophe.thiebaud/posts/10158927764709593).

It is worth to be noted that this hand-made video, with zero promotion effort, enjoys a constant above-average - when not close to high - relative audience retention.

Thanks,
